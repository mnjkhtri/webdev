so yeah this is me trying to figure out web dev:

1. static file hosting - just open the damn index in the browser
2. static web server - apparently opening a file directly wasnt enough so here's nginx serving those files 
3. dynamic web server - wtf is this fancy chaos

cd into this cause we rolling into it

there are scripts to install dependencies:
```
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

and run the processes
```
bash scripts/start.sh
```
fancy a docker mate?
```
docker compose up
```

boilerplate done. now i am making a banger todo app ðŸ¤“
