so yeah this is me trying to figure out web dev:

1. static file hosting - just open the damn index in the browser
2. static web server - apparently opening a file directly wasnt enough so here's nginx serving those files 
3. dynamic web server - wtf is this fancy chaos. fuck you next js
4. dash - all Python
